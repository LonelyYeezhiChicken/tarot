# Proposal: Define Documentation Structure

## Summary

This proposal outlines the structure and initial content for the project's documentation. The documentation will cover the project's purpose, technical stack, architecture, and how to contribute, aligning with the project's goal of being a "pure frontend, no backend, deployable on GitHub Pages Tarot card drawing and interpretation website."

## Motivation

As the project grows, clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for new contributors, maintainers, and users to understand its design, implementation, and usage. This proposal aims to establish a foundational structure for all future documentation efforts.

## Goals

* Define a clear, logical directory and file structure for all project documentation.
* Outline the key sections and content areas that the documentation will cover.
* Ensure the documentation aligns with the project's technical conventions and architectural patterns.

## Non-Goals

* Implementing the full documentation content. This proposal focuses on structure and outline.
* Changing any existing project code.

## High-Level Plan

1. Define the directory structure for documentation files within the `docs/` directory.
2. Outline the content for key documentation sections such as project overview, technical details, development guide, and deployment instructions.
3. Create placeholder documentation files based on the defined structure.
