# Proposal: Add Card Name to UI

## Why

Currently, the tarot cards only display an emoji and an image. To improve clarity and user experience, we should add the card's name as a small line of text on the card itself.

## What Changes

This change involves:
1.  Updating the card rendering logic in `src/main.js` to include the card name.
2.  Adding styles in `public/style.css` to format the card name text appropriately.
